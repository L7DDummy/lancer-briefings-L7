## Joint Union Task Force Brief
It has been *1 year and 5 months, Union time* since the reported, supposed cartel the **Pirate Armada** besieged the Union Core World candidate **Elbrus** in the system of **Olypus-7**.

The few survivors of an attempted exodus from the beset planet reported more than one hundred large pirate vessels. The reasoning behind this brutal and certainly unprovoked attack is currently unknown. 

It is however understood that instead of an immediate bombardment, the **Pirate Armada** began a sweeping ground assault following the initiation of their planetary blockade. 

City by city, the **Pirate Ground Forces** obliterated their competition using *Stolen SSC Technology*. The **Elbrus Planetary Defense Forces** fell into disarray due to the technological advantage that the pirates held.

The two largest issues facing any would be rescue force appear to be the pirate's spaceborne battle station, the stolen **SSC Kumonga** and their deployable mobile battlebase, the **SSC Gamera**.
