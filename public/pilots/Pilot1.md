## Hildegard "Hilde" Weiss

Ex-mechanic for a small fringe colony, Hilde went on a trip into the diaspora to find herself and got more than she bargained for when meeting an old family friend. Now she's a lancer pilot, specialising in support, search and rescue. Detail oriented and task focused with a strong sense of justice, Hilde is naturally a very measured and cautious person but has learnt to channel aspects of her reckless ancestry when risks need to be taken to save lives.
